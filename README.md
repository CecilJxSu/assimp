# assimp

Java porting of [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp)

This port is being written trying to stick as much as possible close to the C version in order to:

- reduce any future maintenance to keep it up with the C version
- reduce any possible difference for peoples used to dev/work with Assimp

#Supported formats at the moment:

- STL - wip (50%)
- MD2 - to update (80%)
