# assimp

Java porting of [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp)

This port is being written trying to stick as much as possible close to the C version in order to:

- reduce any future maintenance to keep it up with the C version
- reduce any possible difference for peoples used to dev/work with Assimp

#Supported formats at the moment:

- MD2

# Core right now:

- most of the Ai Identity
- Validation (almost, need to finish animation)
- BaseProcess (writing triangulation mesh)

Missing/incomplete:
- ScenePreprocessor
