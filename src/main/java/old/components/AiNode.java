 A node in the imported hierarchy.
 
 Each node has name, a parent node (except for the root node),
 a transformation relative to its parent and possibly several child nodes.
 Simple file formats don't support hierarchical structures - for these formats
 the imported scene does consist of only a single root node without children.

    /** The name of the node.
     *
     * The name might be empty (length of zero) but all nodes which
     * need to be referenced by either bones or animations are named.
     * Multiple nodes may have the same name, except for nodes which are referenced
     * by bones (see #aiBone and #aiMesh::mBones). Their names *must* be unique.
     *
     * Cameras and lights reference a specific node by name - if there
     * are multiple nodes with this name, they are assigned to each of them.
     * <br>
     * There are no limitations with regard to the characters contained in
     * the name string as it is usually taken directly from the source file.
     *
     * Implementations should be able to handle tokens such as whitespace, tabs,
     * line feeds, quotation marks, ampersands etc.
     *
     * Sometimes old introduces new nodes not present in the source file
     * into the hierarchy (usually out of necessity because sometimes the
     * source hierarchy format is simply not compatible). Their names are
     * surrounded by @verbatim <> @endverbatim e.g.
     *  @verbatim<DummyRootNode> @endverbatim.
